# A final word

Now that our application is running in Kubernetes successfully, we can go on to do better things in life. Like make a nice coffee, water the plants or send emails with _Listmonk_ :).

Check out the [Additional Resources](./06_01_Final_additional.md) section to find more resources that will help you with your Kubernetes journey.

This guide will be continuously updated to add more resources and tutorials to help make migration to Kubernetes seamless. If you're interested in contributing, head over to [mr-karan/k8s-deployment-book](https://github.com/mr-karan/k8s-deployment-book) and propose changes by sending PRs/Issues.
